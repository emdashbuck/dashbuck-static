## My Philosophy

### Your website belongs to you.

My goal as a professional is to enlighten and empower my clients. So when you work with me, you keep control of your website and can choose its future. Content updates shouldn't require a developer. I provide explanations and tutoring so my clients know how to care for their websites and data.

### Clear, honest communication is key.

I take pride in my customer service. I answer emails promptly and thoroughly. I do my best to explain technological concepts in an understandable way. When there's a problem to be solved, I am up front about it. My clients find me reliable and straightforward. I specialize in clear documentation and staff training to make sure you get the most out of your website.

### Choices are easier to make if you have good advice.

I am an educator first and a developer second. As such, I want to give you as much information as you need to make good decisions about your tech. There's a famous quote in project management: "Good, Fast, and Cheap: pick two." You can't focus on all three of these goals at once. However, making good technology choices can soften the blow of giving up one of these. I use my expertise to advise my clients on the options for their specific circumstances.

## My Strengths

### Adaptability

I'm a multitool: great to have in a pinch. I fill in the gaps so things stop falling through the cracks. I don't just sling code; I can deliver whatever's missing from your online project. I've done everything from marketing to frontline IT support for 4,000 users. I often provide project management, documentation, software integration, and staff training for my clients.

### Communication

My clients love my friendly and thorough explanations. They're comfortable asking questions, because they know I'll give them an honest answer. I make the complicated, sometimes overwhelming online world a little easier to handle.
